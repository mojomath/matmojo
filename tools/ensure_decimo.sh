# Make the `decimo` arbitrary-precision package available to the Linamo build.
#
# Linamo does not compile without it. `Matrix` and `MatrixView` name
# `decimo.Numeric` in the `where` clauses that give a `Matrix[BInt]` its
# arithmetic, and Mojo has no conditional imports, so decimo is a hard
# dependency of the whole library rather than of one corner of it. The trait
# has to live in decimo because Mojo conformance is nominal and is declared
# where the struct is.
#
# Three sources, tried in order:
#
#   1. `DECIMO_PATH=/path/to/decimo` --- a working copy, for developing the two
#      libraries together. This is the path to use while a decimo change is
#      still uncommitted.
#   2. The conda package `decimo` from the modular-community channel. This is
#      the normal source: `decimo >=0.13.0` is a workspace dependency, and
#      v0.13.0 is the release that carries `decimo.Numeric`, `decimo.Parsable`
#      and `decimo.errors`.
#   3. The upstream git repository, pinned at $DECIMO_COMMIT. Only reached when
#      the environment has no decimo --- a checkout built before the dependency
#      was added, or a deliberate `LINAMO_DECIMO=git`.
#
# The package is always *precompiled with this workspace's own `mojo`*. A
# `.mojoc` built by another environment's compiler is not loadable here: it
# does not fail to import, it crashes the compiler, which is a long way to
# travel for a stale artefact.
#
# Usage:
#   bash tools/ensure_decimo.sh            # auto-detect
#
# Environment overrides:
#   DECIMO_PATH=<dir>      build from a local working copy
#   LINAMO_DECIMO=conda    require the environment-provided package
#   LINAMO_DECIMO=git      force the pinned git checkout
#   DECIMO_COMMIT=<sha>    use a different upstream commit
#   DECIMO_REPO=<url>      use a different upstream repository

# gets deleted as a stale shadow of a conda package that was never installed.
