## Matrix class

The `Matrix` class owns its data and can write to it. The elements are stored in a contiguous block of memory in either row-major (C-contiguous) or column-major (Fortran-contiguous) order.

## MatrixView class

The `MatrixView` class is a non-owning view of a matrix. It can be used to create submatrices or to view the same data with different offsets, shapes, and strides. A `MatrixView` cannot write to the data it views, and it does not manage the memory of the data.

## Inter-operability of Matrix and MatrixView

The `Matrix` and `MatrixView` classes are designed to inter-operate seamlessly. You can create a `MatrixView` from a `Matrix`, and you can also create a new `Matrix` from a `MatrixView`. This allows for flexible manipulation of matrix data without unnecessary copying, while still maintaining clear ownership semantics.

If an operation is conducted between a `Matrix` and a `MatrixView`, the result is typically a new `Matrix` that owns its data.

The operations can be defined using generic functions that accept both `Matrix` and `MatrixView` types, allowing for polymorphic behavior while ensuring that the underlying data is handled correctly based on ownership and mutability rules.

## Order of memory layout

The `Matrix` class supports both row-major (C-contiguous) and column-major (Fortran-contiguous) memory layouts. The order of memory layout can be specified when creating a `Matrix`, and it determines how the elements are stored in memory.

To optimize the performance of matrix operations, some functions may be implemented in several versions that are optimized for different memory layouts. For example, matrix multiplication may have separate implementations for:

1. c@c: Both matrices are row-major.
1. f@f: Both matrices are column-major.
1. c@f, f@c: A row-major matrix multiplied by a column-major matrix, and vice versa.
1. c@v, f@v, v@c, v@f: A matrix multiplied by a non-contiguous view. This may require a naive implementation that does not assume any specific memory layout for the view.
