"""
Matrices of arbitrary-precision numbers.

A `Matrix` takes an element *type*, so `Matrix[BInt]` is an ordinary matrix
with the ordinary operators. Everything structural -- slicing, transposition,
reshaping, sorting -- is the same code that serves `Matrix[Float64]`, and the
arithmetic differs only in where it comes from: a `Float64` gets it from a
vector instruction, a `BInt` from its own `+`. `a + b` and `a @ b` are spelled
the same either way.

The element types are re-exported by Linamo, so this file imports nothing but
`linamo`.

Run with:

```bash
pixi run examples
```
